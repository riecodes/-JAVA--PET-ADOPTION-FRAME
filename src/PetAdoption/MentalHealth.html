                <h1>DEFINITION</h1>
                <p>Mental health refers to a person's emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how people think, feel, and act, and helps determine how they handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.</p>

                <h1>IMPORTANCE</h1>
                <p>Good mental health is essential to overall well-being. It allows individuals to cope with the normal stresses of life, work productively, and contribute to their communities. Mental health problems are common but treatable. Many people experience mental health concerns from time to time, but a mental health concern becomes a mental illness when ongoing signs and symptoms cause frequent stress and affect a person's ability to function.</p>

                <p>
                   Simply giving someone space to talk, and listening
                   to how they're feeling, can be really helpful in 
                   itself. If they're finding it difficult, let them 
                   know that you're there when they are ready.

                    Seeking help can feel lonely, and sometimes 
                    scary. You can reassure someone by letting 
                    them know that they are not alone, and that 
                    you will be there to help.

                    Part of the emotional support you offer could 
                    be to keep things as normal as possible. This 
                    could include involving your friend or family 
                    member in social events, or chatting about 
                    other parts of your lives.
